# Introduction to Data-Science-and-Analytics
## What is Data Science?
<p align="justify">Data science is a field that uses scientific methods, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge from data. It uses statistics, scientific computing, and processes to do this.</p>

<p align ="justify">The data science lifecycle is a collection of steps that are taken to prepare and execute a data science project. These steps include:</p>

* Identifying the project goals
* Gathering relevant data
* Analyzing the data using appropriate tools and techniques
* Presenting the results in a meaningful way

Some of the most common data science steps include Data extraction, Preparation, Cleansing, Modeling, and Evaluation. 

**Data Visualization** is the process of presenting the findings of an analysis in a visual manner. This can be done using graphs, scatter plots, heat maps, and bar charts. 

**Data Scientists** develop algorithms and models to support machine learning programs. They use machine learning to classify or categorize data or to make predictions related to the models. 

## What is Data Analytics?

<p align="justify">Analytics is the discovery and communication of meaningful patterns in data. Especially, valuable in areas rich with recorded information, analytics relies on the simultaneous application of statistics, computer programming, and operation research to qualify performance. Analytics often favors data visualization to communicate insight.</p>

# Introduction to Python
<p align="justify">Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming. 

Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[36] Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2. Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages and has gained widespread use in the machine-learning community.</p>
